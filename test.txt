You're such a good person. Thanks for your hard work and your amazing music!

Hope you enjoy your life! I will do whatever I want to do, no matter how hard it is. 

For exmaple, learn coding, machine learning. I'm not sure if I could receive an offer, but this is might be my only chance!

So I will look up to you and live the life to the fullest!
